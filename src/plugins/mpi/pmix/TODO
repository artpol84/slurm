The list of thing stat remain unfixed in this plugin

* Fix finalization logic

There might be several ways to do that:
1. Current SLURM mpi plugin API doesn't have finalization routine for stepd's. 
I've asked for it, if it would be added - this will completely solve the finalization
problem.
2. I intend to extend PMIx server-side API to make it clear when all processes are finalzed.

* Add direct modex timer check to avoid application forever-hangs in case there was communication 
error.
